# ðŸš² NYC Bikeshare Analysis

Shane Fitzpatrick 

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project explores NYC Bikeshare data (2015â€“2017) to help the Department of Transportation understand trends in usage, rider behavior, and station demand. It includes data cleaning, visual exploration, regression analysis, and geospatial calculations.

## ðŸ§  Research Questions
1. **When do people ride the most?**  
   â†’ Visualized daily trip volume to detect seasonality and trends.

2. **Do older riders take longer trips?**  
   â†’ Used scatterplots and linear regression to explore age vs. duration.

3. **Can we predict trip distance?**  
   â†’ Engineered a `distance` feature using the Haversine formula and modeled it via OLS regression.

4. **Where is demand the highest?**  
   â†’ Identified top stations based on trip volume to guide resource allocation.

## ðŸ“Š Key Tools
- `pandas`, `numpy` for data wrangling  
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn` for visualizations  
- `statsmodels` for regression analysis  
- Jupyter for clean, annotated storytelling

## ðŸŽ¯ Insights
- Bikeshare activity has clear temporal trends.
- Younger users tend to ride longer.
- Demand prediction is viable using available features.
- Grove St PATH is the most popular station, with actionable implications for supply.

## ðŸ§° Next Steps
- Incorporate weather and seasonality into demand models  
- Cluster user types by behavior  
- Deploy dashboards for real-time planning
